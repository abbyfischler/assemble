> Hey! Thanks for checking out `hackclub/assemble` :grin:. This repository is a work-in-progress as we wrap up our work on Assemble. As we develop the repository, we'd love your support through [issues](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/issues) & [pull requests](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/pulls). Specifically, we'd love to hear from high schoolers about what information you'd like to see included in the repository! 

Many Hack Clubbers in 2022 had heard about great IRL hackathons, but very few had been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit, and went missing as the world emerged from the pandemic. Our 2022 summer project was to kick off a hackathon renaissance, together with Hack Clubbers. 

To do this, we hosted the first high-school hackathon in San Francisco since the pandemic began, open sourced the entire event (here!) & [launched a series of supports](https://hackclub.com/hackathons/) for high school hackathon organisers based on our experience.

The goal of this repository is to be a guiding reference for high schoolers looking to organise their own hackathon. No hackathon is the same but we hope that within this repository you find inspiration for you own special event.

## ‚ú® The Philosophy

A hackathon is not an extracurricular or a club. It's not a class or a lecture. Hackathons are a place to build things for fun and meet others doing the same.

## üìù Assembling Assemble

The majority of work on Assemble was done in a month, from July 5th to August 5th. Every week of that month, [@sampoder](https://github.com/sampoder) wrote a journal update on the Assemble organising process. Together they tell the story of how Assemble went from an idea to an event for 150+ hackers.
