> Hey! Thanks for checking out `hackclub/assemble` :grin:. This repository is a work-in-progress as we wrap up our work on Assemble. As we develop the repository, we'd love your support through [issues](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/issues) & [pull requests](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/pulls). Specifically, we'd love to hear from high schoolers about what information you'd like to see included in the repository! 

Many Hack Clubbers in 2022 had heard about great IRL hackathons, but very few had been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit, and went missing as the world emerged from the pandemic. Our 2022 summer project was to kick off a hackathon renaissance, together with Hack Clubbers. 

To do this, we hosted the first [high-school hackathon](https://twitter.com/hackclub/status/1556433548361338881) in San Francisco since 2020, [open sourced](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble) the entire event & [launched a series of supports](https://hackclub.com/hackathons/) for high school hackathon organisers based on our experience.

The goal of this repository is to be a guiding reference for high schoolers looking to organise their own hackathon. No hackathon is the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event.

## ‚ú® The Philosophy

A hackathon is not an extracurricular or a club. It's not a class or a lecture. Hackathons are a place to build things for fun and meet others doing the same. Going into organising Assemble, we brainstormed what a magical hackathon looked like, from those brainstorms we developed the following framework for a great hackathon:

- Hackers are prompted to create weird & wacky projects.
- Hackers feel ownership of the event.
- Hackers walk away with a set of unique and memorable experiences.
- Hackers are provided with the opportunity to form personal connections.
- Organisers are consistently involved and passionate at the event.

## üìÜ The Event

Assemble ran from 6PM on Friday to noon on Sunday. That's 42 hours to make our own. Creating a great hackathon, means designing a spectacular attendee experience as well as a great organiser experience. There are a fair few components to this including, but not limited to, planned activities, judging, swag, food and ceremonies. The specifics of each at Assemble are detailed in their respective files in [`/the-event`](/the-event).

## ü´Ç The Attendees

The people are what bring a hackathon alive.

### üìù Assembling Assemble

The majority of work on Assemble was done in a month, from July 5th to August 5th. Every week of that month, [@sampoder](https://github.com/sampoder) wrote a journal update on the Assemble organising process. Together they tell the story of how Assemble went from an idea to an event for 150+ hackers.
