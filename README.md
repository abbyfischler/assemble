# Assemble - August 5th to 7th, 2022

_150+ Hackers ~ 42 Hours ~ Figma HQ, San Francisco_

> Hey! Thanks for checking out `hackclub/assemble` :grin:. This repository is a work-in-progress as we wrap up our work on Assemble. As we develop the repository, we'd love your support through [issues](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/issues) & [pull requests](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/pulls). Specifically, we'd love to hear from high schoolers about what information you'd like to see included in the repository! 

Many Hack Clubbers in 2022 had heard about great IRL hackathons, but very few had been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit, and went missing as the world emerged from the pandemic. Our 2022 summer project was to kick off a hackathon renaissance, together with Hack Clubbers. 

To do this, we hosted the first high-school hackathon in San Francisco since the pandemic began, open sourced the entire event (here!) & launched a series of supports for high school hackathon organisers based on our experience.

## üíµ Finances

The finances for Assemble are open sourced [here](https://bank.hackclub.com/assemble) through Hack Club Bank's [transparency mode](https://headwayapp.co/bank-changelog/transparent-finances-(optional-feature)-151427).
