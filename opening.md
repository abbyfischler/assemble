# Opening Ceremony Script

_"Hackers, ASSEMBLE!" Video_

Sam: Good evening everyone! And welcome to Assemble, here in the phenomonal Figma office. We're incredibly grateful to have the oppourtinity to host you for a special weekend. Many of you have travelled many miles to join us, we're humbled. Wherever you've travelled from, we hope to make this weekend magical for you.

My message to you is simple, use this weekend as an oppourtinity to advenuture, both technically and socially. Build the unexpected project, new friendships and memories for a lifetime.

We don't want to stop at this weekend, however, we want this weekend to kickstart a renaisance of IRL high school hackathons.

Ishan: We've got an exciting schedule lined up for this weekend. _run through schedule_

Ian: Throughout this weekend, we'll all be sharing what we get up to on our Scrapbook. You'll be able to find it at `assemble.hackclub.com`. On there, you can explore or post both ships and scraps. A scrap is a moment from the event, it could be the dinner you make, when you fix a bug, add another feature to your project or a curiousity you find on the scavenger hunt tomorrow. On the other hand, a ship is a finished project or as close as you'll get to one this weekend. For every ship you make you'll recieve a card such as this one. When we demo our projects, we'll each be able to scan these cards using NFC or the QR code and then select five emojis to describe the project. The emojis you choose will decide who wins what at the closing ceremony. 

Let's all try it out, head to `assemble.hackclub.com`, log in with your Assemble ID and post a selfie with those around you as a Scrap.

Sam: There's one thing I can imagine is on all of your minds, what should I build? A week ago, we asked you to submit prompt ideas, now, we're going to use those to choose a prompt, togther. We hope this prompt will inspire you and set you off in a creative direction, but it's nothing more than a prompt and certainly not a requirement.

Sam: We've got a theme, a scrapbook to post to, we've ran through the schedule and are all set with our theme of [INSERT THEME]. So what are we all waiting for? Get chatting with the folks around you, start brainstorming [INSERT THEME] projects, grab some Vietnamese food for dinner and let the hackathon begin!
