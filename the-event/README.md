# ðŸ“† The Event

> Placeholder description!

Assemble ran from 6PM on Friday to 12PM on Sunday. That's 42 hours to make our own. Creating a great hackathon, means designing a spectacular attendee experience as well as a great organiser experience. There are a fair few components to this including, but not limited to, planned activities, judging, swag, food and ceremonies. The specifics of each at Assemble are detailed in their respective files in [`/the-event`](/the-event).

Our general principle when event designing was to place ourselves in the shoes of those involved and to guided by the above principles. At times, you do have to balance great ideas with practical constraints but modifications can be made to ideas to make them practical. We made sure to consider the organiser experience because organisers set the tone of the event
