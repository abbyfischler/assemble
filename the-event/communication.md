# üíå Communication

With so many hackers & a lot of last minute preparation, attendee communication was one of our biggest challenges.

</ul>

##### Traveling To Figma‚Äôs San Francisco Office

Figma's office is located at: [760 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102](https://goo.gl/maps/E3218Y7c9ZJU7AWa9) (near Union Square).

The building is locked by security, and attendees will not be permitted to enter before 6pm on Friday Aug 5th. If you arrive before 6pm, there will be Hack Club staff at [Yerba Buena Gardens](https://yerbabuenagardens.com/) from 10am to 6pm on Friday. Yerba Buena is a beautiful park near to the venue. It‚Äôs a great place to chill and hang out and meet other attendees until the venue door is open.

###### Checking in to the Venue

In the Figma lobby on the ground floor, you will first be required to sign-in to the building. Security will have everyone‚Äôs name on a list, and there will be someone from Hack Club there to welcome you & guide you to the 5th floor where Assemble is!

###### Local Participants & Early Arrivers (arriving before 8AM on Friday, August 5th)

Figma‚Äôs offices are located on Market Street, near Union Square. We recommend taking BART to Powell Street and then walking two blocks down Market Street to Figma‚Äôs offices. Google Maps, Apple Maps & [bart.gov/planner](https://www.bart.gov/planner) are useful tools for directions and train arrival times.

###### Travelers Arriving By Plane (arriving between 8AM & 5PM on Friday, August 5th)

Those traveling to San Francisco on the day of the event are welcome to make their own way to the venue. We‚Äôll also be offering supervised BART transportation to the venue. A Hack Club staff member will be waiting at the AirTrain platform next to the BART station [(view this map)](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/documents/station/san-francisco-international-airport-station-map.pdf) from 8am to 12 midnight on Friday. You‚Äôll be able to take the BART with them to Market Street and then explore the surrounding area or head to Yerba Buena.

If your flight into SF is **delayed**, please contact Rick Blount at +1 (802) 233-0635. This will help us keep track of your travels. If you are transiting during your journey and a leg of your flight is delayed, leading to you requiring a rebooking of your next flight, please first go to the airline / airport staff, then contact your parents and if you need further support contact Rick.

##### Getting Home After The Event

We will also be offering supervised BART transportation to the airport after the event on Sunday Aug 7 at 12PM & 6PM. The estimated travel time is 45mins, so please account for this to ensure you do not miss your flight‚Äôs check in. Ensure you are also checking the status of your flights during the day, to check for changes in flight departure times.

The 12PM transportation group will depart from Figma‚Äôs office, immediately after the closing ceremony. The 6PM transportation group will depart from the Figma office entrance on the ground floor.

For those who have late flights, we‚Äôll have an outdoor gathering place (again in Yerba Buena Gardens) for you to chill with other Hack Clubbers & HQ staff.

We will have Hack Club staff at the San Francisco International Airport from 12:45pm to 10pm on Sunday to support you. They will be stationed at the AirTrain platform next to the SFO BART Station.

##### The (Un)Talent Show & Lightning Talks

We have two fun side activities that we‚Äôd love to have the community involved in!

First, the **üé§ (Un)Talent Show**, where you can present or perform anything to your fellow hackers! It‚Äôll be chill and informal, so there‚Äôs no pressure. Heck, show us what you‚Äôre incredibly bad at (ever seen Ishan shuffle a deck of cards? *shudder*) Feel free to bring any objects or props, and if you need anything we can help you acquire it!

Second, **‚ö°Lightning Talks**, where hackers give quick talks about intriguing things in rapid succession. Come up with some slides or present without them. We recommend keeping ‚Äòem short short: about 2-3 minutes. Example ideas: ‚ÄúHow bad is PHP?‚Äù & ‚ÄúWhy pineapple deserves to be on pizza.‚Äù (56.5% of you agree according to your registrations).

Fill out this form if you‚Äôd like to get involved: [hack.af/assemble-side-activities](https://hack.af/assemble-side-activities)!

Please reach out to assemble@hackclub.com if you have any additional questions or need further support with your travel.

Thank you for taking the time to read this important email fully.

Looking forward to meeting you all,

Sam with the Assemble Team

#### One Week Out

<p>G‚Äôday!</p>
<p>Sam here, from the Hack Club team. We‚Äôre a week out from Assemble and we‚Äôre super excited to be having you there! Just reaching out as a reminder to complete the following two tasks before midnight on Tuesday the 2nd of August (EST):</p>
<p><strong>Submit proof of full vaccination:</strong> please visit the unique URL sent in last week‚Äôs email (don't have it? send a reply and we'll get it to you!), set a password and upload an image that proves your full vaccination status (eg. a vaccine card).</p>
<p><strong>Complete the Event Liability Release:</strong> please refer to the email from ‚ÄúHack Club via DocuSign‚Äù and complete the liability waiver by following the instructions it outlines. Alternatively, if DocuSign is not functioning, please sign the attached PDF copy and send it <a href="mailto:assemble@hackclub.com">assemble@hackclub.com</a>.</p>
<p>We've got an large&nbsp;waitlist, if you don't complete these two tasks, you will unfortunately&nbsp;lose your spot.&nbsp;If you‚Äôve already completed your forms, thank you!&nbsp;COVID-19 test uploading will open next week. Please remember to upload your test within 24 hours of your first flight‚Äôs departure time or the event starting, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>On a more exciting note, at Assemble we‚Äôll all be&nbsp;voting on a ‚Äúprompt‚Äù for the event to inspire project ideas. It‚Äôs like a theme at other hackathons, but people don‚Äôt have to follow it, and you all select one! <a href="https://airtable.com/shruu8mVaHpnlFEn2">You can submit your own prompt here for the ballot.</a> Thank you!</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need any additional support or help with these tasks. For reference, I‚Äôve also attached last Friday‚Äôs logistical update.</p>
<p><strong>Please note one correction for travellers, </strong>Hack Club staff will be stationed at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fUhGapZNZbhhfDzU7">‚ÄúStarbucks International Arrival‚Äù</a> on Friday at San Francisco International Airport instead of the AirLink terminal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to it,</p>
<p>Sam &amp; the Assemble Team</p>
