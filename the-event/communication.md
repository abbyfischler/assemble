# üíå Communication

With so many hackers & a lot of last minute preparation, attendee communication was one of our biggest challenges. 

## Pre-Event

Most of our formal communication before the event came through email, with informal support & communications done over the Hack Club Slack. (FYI: all marketing emails are in `the-attendees/marketing.md`)

### Emails

We must receive **proof of full vaccination as defined [by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) by midnight EST on Tuesday, 2nd August** or you will not be allowed to enter the premises.

<li>Personal health items like prescription medicines, epipens, insulin, inhalers, etc. Make sure that they will last the duration of the weekend.</li>
<li>A change of clothes (optional, but recommended). Who knows? You might want to change after 42 hours of hacking :D</li>
<li>A sleeping bag (optional, but recommended). One of these will help you get a good night's sleep! Each evening we‚Äôll have a dedicated floor in the office with gender separated rooms. These rooms are spacious with a variety of couches, chairs, or carpets for you to set up camp on. They‚Äôll be dimly lit and supervised.</li></ul>

Research your airline‚Äôs specific requirements based on your place of departure, airline and nationality.</li>
</ul>

##### Traveling To Figma‚Äôs San Francisco Office

Figma's office is located at: [760 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102](https://goo.gl/maps/E3218Y7c9ZJU7AWa9) (near Union Square).

The building is locked by security, and attendees will not be permitted to enter before 6pm on Friday Aug 5th. If you arrive before 6pm, there will be Hack Club staff at [Yerba Buena Gardens](https://yerbabuenagardens.com/) from 10am to 6pm on Friday. Yerba Buena is a beautiful park near to the venue. It‚Äôs a great place to chill and hang out and meet other attendees until the venue door is open.

###### Checking in to the Venue

In the Figma lobby on the ground floor, you will first be required to sign-in to the building. Security will have everyone‚Äôs name on a list, and there will be someone from Hack Club there to welcome you & guide you to the 5th floor where Assemble is!

###### Local Participants & Early Arrivers (arriving before 8AM on Friday, August 5th)

Figma‚Äôs offices are located on Market Street, near Union Square. We recommend taking BART to Powell Street and then walking two blocks down Market Street to Figma‚Äôs offices. Google Maps, Apple Maps & [bart.gov/planner](https://www.bart.gov/planner) are useful tools for directions and train arrival times.

###### Travelers Arriving By Plane (arriving between 8AM & 5PM on Friday, August 5th)

Those traveling to San Francisco on the day of the event are welcome to make their own way to the venue. We‚Äôll also be offering supervised BART transportation to the venue. A Hack Club staff member will be waiting at the AirTrain platform next to the BART station [(view this map)](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/documents/station/san-francisco-international-airport-station-map.pdf) from 8am to 12 midnight on Friday. You‚Äôll be able to take the BART with them to Market Street and then explore the surrounding area or head to Yerba Buena.

If your flight into SF is **delayed**, please contact Rick Blount at +1 (802) 233-0635. This will help us keep track of your travels. If you are transiting during your journey and a leg of your flight is delayed, leading to you requiring a rebooking of your next flight, please first go to the airline / airport staff, then contact your parents and if you need further support contact Rick.

##### Getting Home After The Event

We will also be offering supervised BART transportation to the airport after the event on Sunday Aug 7 at 12PM & 6PM. The estimated travel time is 45mins, so please account for this to ensure you do not miss your flight‚Äôs check in. Ensure you are also checking the status of your flights during the day, to check for changes in flight departure times.

The 12PM transportation group will depart from Figma‚Äôs office, immediately after the closing ceremony. The 6PM transportation group will depart from the Figma office entrance on the ground floor.

For those who have late flights, we‚Äôll have an outdoor gathering place (again in Yerba Buena Gardens) for you to chill with other Hack Clubbers & HQ staff.

We will have Hack Club staff at the San Francisco International Airport from 12:45pm to 10pm on Sunday to support you. They will be stationed at the AirTrain platform next to the SFO BART Station.

##### The (Un)Talent Show & Lightning Talks

We have two fun side activities that we‚Äôd love to have the community involved in!

First, the **üé§ (Un)Talent Show**, where you can present or perform anything to your fellow hackers! It‚Äôll be chill and informal, so there‚Äôs no pressure. Heck, show us what you‚Äôre incredibly bad at (ever seen Ishan shuffle a deck of cards? *shudder*) Feel free to bring any objects or props, and if you need anything we can help you acquire it!

Second, **‚ö°Lightning Talks**, where hackers give quick talks about intriguing things in rapid succession. Come up with some slides or present without them. We recommend keeping ‚Äòem short short: about 2-3 minutes. Example ideas: ‚ÄúHow bad is PHP?‚Äù & ‚ÄúWhy pineapple deserves to be on pizza.‚Äù (56.5% of you agree according to your registrations).

Fill out this form if you‚Äôd like to get involved: [hack.af/assemble-side-activities](https://hack.af/assemble-side-activities)!

Please reach out to assemble@hackclub.com if you have any additional questions or need further support with your travel.

Thank you for taking the time to read this important email fully.

Looking forward to meeting you all,

Sam with the Assemble Team

#### We're one week out from Assemble!

<p>G‚Äôday!</p>
<p>Sam here, from the Hack Club team. We‚Äôre a week out from Assemble and we‚Äôre super excited to be having you there! Just reaching out as a reminder to complete the following two tasks before midnight on Tuesday the 2nd of August (EST):</p>
<p><strong>Submit proof of full vaccination:</strong> please visit the unique URL sent in last week‚Äôs email (don't have it? send a reply and we'll get it to you!), set a password and upload an image that proves your full vaccination status (eg. a vaccine card).</p>
<p><strong>Complete the Event Liability Release:</strong> please refer to the email from ‚ÄúHack Club via DocuSign‚Äù and complete the liability waiver by following the instructions it outlines. Alternatively, if DocuSign is not functioning, please sign the attached PDF copy and send it <a href="mailto:assemble@hackclub.com">assemble@hackclub.com</a>.</p>
<p>We've got an large&nbsp;waitlist, if you don't complete these two tasks, you will unfortunately&nbsp;lose your spot.&nbsp;If you‚Äôve already completed your forms, thank you!&nbsp;COVID-19 test uploading will open next week. Please remember to upload your test within 24 hours of your first flight‚Äôs departure time or the event starting, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>On a more exciting note, at Assemble we‚Äôll all be&nbsp;voting on a ‚Äúprompt‚Äù for the event to inspire project ideas. It‚Äôs like a theme at other hackathons, but people don‚Äôt have to follow it, and you all select one! <a href="https://airtable.com/shruu8mVaHpnlFEn2">You can submit your own prompt here for the ballot.</a> Thank you!</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need any additional support or help with these tasks. For reference, I‚Äôve also attached last Friday‚Äôs logistical update.</p>
<p><strong>Please note one correction for travellers, </strong>Hack Club staff will be stationed at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fUhGapZNZbhhfDzU7">‚ÄúStarbucks International Arrival‚Äù</a> on Friday at San Francisco International Airport instead of the AirLink terminal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to it,</p>
<p>Sam &amp; the Assemble Team</p>

#### üëã Hi! I'm Rick, your travel point of contact for Assemble.

Good morning/afternoon/evening,

Rick from Hack Club here. I‚Äôm going to be available to help in the unlikely case that travel plans go off-track.

To help you avoid and deal with any issues yourselves, we‚Äôre sending along this tip sheet. We highly recommend you save this on your phone or print it out.

Our main advice is to prepare well for travel and advocate for yourself quickly if you miss a flight. If you‚Äôre really stuck and can‚Äôt find a solution, reach out to your parents ...and then reach out to me if you‚Äôre still stuck.

Don‚Äôt panic with late arrivals; though‚Äìyou‚Äôll be able to get into Assemble no matter what time you arrive! (Do let me know if you‚Äôll arrive after 11pm, when our staff at SFO airport will be leaving.)

Have a great time in SFO!

**Rick**  
**Voice/Text:** REDACTED
**Slack:** @rick  
_I‚Äôll be on call to help on Friday the 5th as you‚Äôre flying in and Sunday the 7th as you‚Äôre flying out. If for some reason you can‚Äôt reach me, leave a message and/or try: Kara @kara on slack or REDACTED or Sam Poder @sampoder on Slack or REDACTED._

#### Tomorrow Assemble begins! (Aug 5th)

üëã Hey there!

I just spent my first day in SF setting up at Figma HQ with the team! It‚Äôs such a magical space and we're all so excited to welcome you to it and meet IRL in SF.

![](https://cloud-g9q5guad4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_8409.jpg)

_Running errands in SF with some of the team!_

If you‚Äôre receiving this email, that means we‚Äôve received both your event liability waiver and proof of vaccination. Thank you!

**The final step is to upload your proof of a negative COVID-19 test result.**

If you are travelling by plane, we require you to take and submit the results of your at home test within the 24 hours before your flight to SF‚Äôs departure time.

For those who are not travelling by plane, we require you to take and submit the results of your at home tests within the 24 hours before the event‚Äôs start time (6PM PST, August 5th).

This can be done on  [ticketing.assemble.hackclub.com](http://ticketing.assemble.hackclub.com/), the same place where you submitted your vaccination status. After we receive & review your test result submission, you‚Äôll receive a confirmation email from us with a QR code that can be used to check-in to the venue. Please screenshot and save this QR code, it can also be added to your Apple Wallet.

Also a reminder for those travelling by plane, we will be having a BART chaperoning service with Hack Club staff from SFO to Market Street running on Friday 5th of August from 8AM to 11PM. To join this group, please meet at the Starbucks in the International Arrivals Section. Look out for the red bandanas and Hack Club stickers!

For those arriving domestically, to get to the Starbucks, you‚Äôll need to take the AirTrain to ‚ÄúInternational Terminal G‚Äù (make sure you don‚Äôt get off at ‚ÄúInternational Garage G‚Äù and then take a short walk downstairs to arrivals, which we‚Äôve documented in this (slightly hacky) video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLRcRjxbQmU. For international arrivals, Starbucks will be on your left as you exit the terminal.

Thank you so much for your support in keeping Assemble safe,

Sam

PS: check out my plane for the first leg of my journey to SF!

#### Assemble begins today!

üëã Hey there!

It‚Äôs almost time! We‚Äôve been spending the past two days setting up and we‚Äôre so excited to welcome you Assemble at Figma on Market Street.

If you haven‚Äôt already, don‚Äôt forget to test yourself for COVID-19 and upload your negative result to  [ticketing.assemble.hackclub.com](https://ticketing.assemble.hackclub.com/)! After doing so, we'll review it and you'll receive an email with a QR code (for check-in) from us. Please also re-familiarize yourself with the logistical details emailed in our original email (attached!). It includes instructions for traveling from the airport and emergency contact information for the event.

On a more personal note, yesterday I got to meet five Hack Clubbers, and today I'll get to meet 150+ (including yourself!). I couldn't be more excited (alongside feeling a series of other emotions) :D At the event, let's make sure to meet up and get to know each other more!

Hackers, assemble!

Sam

PS: here‚Äôs our team hacking away in the Figma office late last night! We can't wait to hack with you.

![](https://cloud-6an09t1t0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image_from_ios.jpg)

#### [Important Update] How to get into the Venue Building for Assemble

Hey there!

We have a small change as to how you will be entering the Figma space in the Phelan building. An email will be coming from their building security at 5:00 PM with a link. This allows you entry and exit through the front door from 6:00 PM until curfew at 10:00 PM. (Note: if your flight is delayed and your arrival is post 10:00 PM, don‚Äôt worry‚Äî we‚Äôll get you in!).

**This link is only good until curfew. A new one will be generated Saturday and Sunday mornings and emailed to you.**

There is also an iPad for sign-in in the lobby that you can use, but there is only one, so to avoid bottlenecks please use the link provided.

If you have any trouble, the security knows of our event and has a list of all attendees.

Hack Club will have staff in the lobby from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM assisting anyone who needs it as well.

If you have any trouble, DM me on slack [@kara](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U032A2PMSE9) or text or call _REDACTED_

Best, Kara

#### Thank you for joining us at Assemble! ‚ù§Ô∏è


üëã Hello again!

To start, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for taking your weekend to come to Assemble! I love how, with movie nights, Jackbox games and more, everyone made the event their own. The talent show acts, the lightning talks and the workshops presented over the weekend were especially remarkable.

Assemble was magical. You made that happen. For that, thank you.

![](https://cloud-rggqmbbnn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image-3.png)

We've created a shared Google Photos Album to look back on the weekend and to share photos from your adventures: [https://hack.af/assemble-album](https://hack.af/assemble-album)! If you haven't already added them, it'd be lovely to see your photos from Assemble on there. The documentary made by Kevin, the filmmaker, will come out in a few weeks and we‚Äôll send an email with it.

Assemble is only the beginning, we want this to be a special semester of high school hackathons and reestablish the culture around them being IRL.

We want you to **be a part of the [hackathon renaissance](https://hackclub.com/hackathons/)** and announced:

1.  A $500 grant once you have a venue for your hackathon, provided by Hack Club in partnership with  [_FIRST_  Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/).
    
2.  All fees waived on  [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/)  this semester for HS hackathons. That means all the money you raise goes directly towards your hackathon.
    
3.  When you list your hackathon on  [hackathons.hackclub.com](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/), it‚Äôll be shared with local robotics teams through  _FIRST_.
    

We'd also love to have you all **further involved in Hack Club**:

-   If you missed Sprig, the custom open source Hack Club game console,  [join the Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/?continent=North%20America)  and the  [#sprig channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C02UN35M7LG/activity)  to help out with development and test the game engine before consoles start shipping in a few weeks.
    
-   Applications to start a Hack Club this semester are now open at  [hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com/)  ([@rajan](http://github.com/rajanwastaken)  [overhauled the site just before Assemble!](https://github.com/hackclub/apply/pull/68))
    
-   Even if you‚Äôre not starting a hackathon and are instead running an open source project, a Hack Club or robotics team, or another nonprofit project that needs 501(c)(3) status and an easy way to manage funds: Hack Club Bank works with you and you can sign up at  [https://hackclub.com/bank/](https://hackclub.com/bank/).
    
-   [Join the Slack!](https://hackclub.com/slack/)  The Slack is like Assemble, 24/7.
    

Last but not least, **Assemble is being open sourced: [https://github.com/hackclub/assemble](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble)!** I've been [journaling the process of "assembling" Assemble](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/tree/main/updates)  over the past few weeks and just published my final journal which reflects on the weekend. You can  [read it here](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/blob/main/updates/6.md).

As we develop the repository, we'd love your support through issues & pull requests. Specifically, I'd love to hear from you about what you'd like to see included in the repository - please reply directly to this email if you have ideas!

With gratitude and until next time,

Sam & the Assemble team

_Sunset over Shelburne Farms, Vermont._

### Parent Q&As

We also ran three Q&As with parents over Zoom. We'd invite them on for thirty minutes to ask Christina & Sam questions about the event as well as hear our pitch for the event. These were really helpful for parents to become more confident in sending their kid across the world for a hackathon! We normally had five to eight parents in each Q&A.

## At The Event

We had 175 in a massive office space, how do we make sure they all know what's going on?

### Printed Handouts

Our first strategy was to print out brochures with schedules & instructions for certain events. We'd then hand out these brochures during big events such as dinners and ceremonies.

### Schedule Website

On the day of the event we also created a [schedule website](https://assemble-schedule.hackclub.dev) [(view the code here)](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble-schedule) that attendees can use to keep up with ongoing events. We also built a platform to share important links and announcements to the hackers at Assemble, mid-event: https://assemble-feed.hackclub.dev [(view the code here)](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble-feed). 

### Text Messages

Airtable has the ability to [send SMSs through Twilio](https://support.airtable.com/docs/send-sms-block). We used this extension at Assemble to SMS all attendees live updates about the event!

### Herders / Verbal Announcements

Lastly, we had the age-old strategy of simply shouting announcements which became a bit of a meme:

> Probably the most surreal feeling I've experienced this year was knocking out cold for 2-3 hours after a very long day and a half, only to be woken up by a loud booming sam yelling "GOOOOOOD MORNING!!! GOOOOOOOD MORNING TODAY IS SUNDAAAYY IT IS THE BEST DAYYY GOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING!!!" for like 30 minutes
