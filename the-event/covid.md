# COVID-19

> Below is the COVID-19 policy we adopted at Assemble. It was written to keep attendees safe whilst also being practical enough for us to implement. To the best of our knowledge (after contact tracing), there was no COVID-19 transmission at Assemble.

## Before the Hackathon

### Vaccination Requirements

All attendees will be required to submit proof of full vaccination including additional boosters that may become available and recommended before August. Attendees may be asked to show proof at a pre-event check-in and at the entrance of the venue, so **attendees should bring their proof of vaccination**.

### Covid Test Documentation

We require all attendees & organizers produce the results of a negative antigen test within 24 hours of the event or (if flying) before you leave to travel.

### Travel Stipends

Recipients of travel stipends flying in to attend will need to take their tests before boarding their plane.

## At the Hackathon

### Resources

Rapid tests will be provided in the open for anyone to use and hand sanitizer will be located throughout the venue.

Masks are not required at the venue, but will be available for anyone who wishes to wear one.

### Self-report Response

If an attendee or organizer begins to show symptoms and/or has a positive test, they must isolate and leave the event. They are responsible for coordinating housing and rebooking travel if needed.

We will send a notification email to attendees with exposure details if there is a positive test.

## After the Hackathon

### Reporting post-event positive-tests

If an attendee or organizer has a positive test within 7 days of the event, they should report the possible exposure to [self-report link].

To ensure attendees and organizers remember to self-report after the event, a scheduled text message will be sent with the [self-report link].
