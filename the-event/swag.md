For Assemble, we custom-made keychains for attendees to take home as mementos. To make about 170 keychains, we used the following materials:

- 1 sheet of 2mm-thick acrylic (18" x 24")
- Keychain rings

We had access to a laser cutter at the local makerspace in Vermont which we used to cut and engrave the keychains. The total time in the laser cutter for the 18" x 24" sheet was about 60 minutes, and we ended up with about 170 pieces.

Our earlier prototypes were made with scrapwood, but we ended up going with the acrylic instead because it was difficult to source the type of thin wood sheets we would have needed.

One flaw with our keychain design was that the hole at the top was too close to the edge which compromised the durability of the keychain. The hole being close to the top made it easy to put the rings on, but it also made it [easier to break](https://cloud-pghqpha23-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pxl_20220826_194901348.mp.jpg).
