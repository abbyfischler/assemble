# ðŸª… Swag

At Assemble, hackers to walk away with a collection of artifacts from the event. These artifacts would be a lasting memory of the special weekend they'd had in San Francisco. We tried to design our swag to be high quality, and something people would want to keep.

## PCB Badges

I originally made a PCB ticket design for The Hacker Zephyr - it was never brought to production, but I thought a similar thing for Assemble would be really cool. Instead of a ticket (which makes sense for a train), I thought a badge, inspired by the badges I saw people wearing in photos of Flagship, would make more sense for a hackathon. We started making prelimary designs, around "ASSEMBLE" on the front along with the image of a bridge - the same as on the sticker. 

To quickly explain why we decided to go with PCBs, instead of plastic or wood. PCBs gave us an easy option for multiple colors, including access to metallic colors (copper coating: HASL, silver; ENIG, gold; OSP, copper/bronze). We could also get several soldermask colors, like matte black, matte green, and several glossy colors. PCB production has grown very cost efficient in the past half decade, and this option was easier for me to design than a plastic/wood badge. For the name tags, I used my thermal label printer I normally use for mail, picked some 1.5x0.5" labels, and wrote a python script to generate 1.5x0.5 PDFs. Hackers with the freedom waiver would have a second line under their name indicating they had it, and others without had only their name on the label.

After designing the PCB in KiCAD, we had several options to order. We could either do Matte Black / Yellow / Silver, or Matte Black / White / Gold. I ordered prototypes of both, but they arrived too late. Sam made the decision to order the former, and we placed a production order before the prototypes arrived. The production run arrived at Figma HQ on 8/3- phew!

Since I had other things to run around to do, I enlisted the help of Celeste(who later also enlisted Lexi) to attach lanyards to the PCBs, on 8/4. I worked on the script to generate labels, but didn't finish until the morning of the fifth. Then, I enlisted Sarthak and Holly's help sticking labels on and sorting the badges. 

There were some cases where people signed up last minute and weren't on the list I printed out in the morning, but I was able to print labels on demand.

## Postcards

Postcards were a more last-minute thing. I originally floated the idea of bringing some vintage postcards to Assemble - I've been recently adding said cards into sticker boxes and some envelopes, with handwritten messages. I thought that we could establish a mail station where you could mail yourself a card, from Figma @ SF!

However, in Sam's infinite wisdom, he proposed making _custom_ postcards! We decided to go with 5 designs, and ordered 250 from moo. We also decided to have the postcards as a yearbook thing, where you ask others to sign it. Unforunately, most people, excluding 4, didn't know how a postcard worked, so I only really had 4 to mail out. We were supposed to have a "collection bin" where I would stamp them and drop them at the 94102 PO, but Amazon delivered them after the event was over, a full 4 days after its delivery estimate. Go UPS! The postcards were still very nice, and most people took one. I had probably 20-30 left from the original 250.

## Instax Photos

A genius at bank decided to bring an FujiFilm with more than _200_ packs of film! I went around, as the fake photographer, taking images of people. I've also sorted through the images, and will be mailing them out eventually. 

## StickerMule

We ordered a HUGE swag order from StickerMule. This included T-Shirts. We originally considered getting them from Hack Shop's print provider, but they couldn't give us a definitive delivery date. Additionally, other providers like custom ink were difficult to work with, at best. We decided to go with StickerMule, and despite it costing a lot more, we knew the stuff would arrive ahead of schedule. Sam had two *amazing* designs: an outline map of SF streets on black, as well as an oil painting-like portrait, which we used for the final design. We had time to order samples, but we had the image printed too large. Several digital proofs later, 200 shirts(ish) ordered! 

We also placed an emphasis on stickers. We had two designs: the bridge with birds on red, 2x2 rounded, as well as a modified dino saying "Hackers, Assemble!" You can find them on the hack club stickers page. I also previously ordered a sample of a clear sticker, but it didn't really turn out well. We got pins, too! Small metal pins with 3 different orpheusus. 

Also from stickermule, but not placed in this Assemble order, were a large number of Hack Club stickers. A _huge_ box of hack club and bank stickers mailed to figma, with UPS Next Day, albeit _someone_ forgot to add "Fl 10", and had to call UPS to rectify that mistake. However, not many people took as many stickers I expected them to, so I went around begging people to take stickers, until someone wiped the whole place clean! (They later shipped most of them back to me.)

## Keychains

For Assemble, we custom-made keychains for attendees to take home as mementos. To make about 170 keychains, we used the following materials:

- 1 sheet of 2mm-thick acrylic (18" x 24")
- Keychain rings

We had access to a laser cutter at the local makerspace in Vermont which we used to cut and engrave the keychains. The total time in the laser cutter for the 18" x 24" sheet was about 60 minutes, and we ended up with about 170 pieces.

Our earlier prototypes were made with scrapwood, but we ended up going with the acrylic instead because it was difficult to source the type of thin wood sheets we would have needed.

One flaw with our keychain design was that the hole at the top was too close to the edge which compromised the durability of the keychain. The hole being close to the top made it easy to put the rings on, but it also made it [easier to break](https://cloud-pghqpha23-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pxl_20220826_194901348.mp.jpg).
