# ðŸ‘‹ Ceremonies 

At Assemble, we began & finished the hackathon with a large gathering of all the attendees in Figma's courtyard area. The goal of these ceremonies were to have them by high energy, zero-BS & interactive. 

## Opening Ceremony

The ceremony began with a short video documenting how attendees had traveled from around the world into San Francisco, it showed takeoff shots & scenic shots of the city. It ended with "Hackers, assemble!".

Followed by this Sam gave a short welcome to all the attendees:

> Good evening everyone! And welcome to Assemble, here in San Francisco. We're incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to host you for a special weekend. Many of you have traveled many miles to join us, we're humbled. Wherever you've traveled from, we hope to make this weekend magical for you.
>
> My message to you is simple, use this weekend as an opportunity to adventure, both technically and socially. Build the unexpected project at demos, create new friendships and develop everlasting memories.

The ceremony then transitioned to Zach, who introduced Hack Club's hackathon program for the upcoming semester.

Then to run through all the basic logistics details of the event through a slightly awkward parody of an airline safety video.

After the airplane video, Christina (alongside the rest of the event's designated safety team) gave a short speech about safety at the event & how to contact if at anytime you feel uncomfortable.

Sam, then gave a short speech challenging attendees to make the event their own:

> The last thing i want to say before we start voting on the prompt. We're all here together, you, me, the Assemble team we're high schoolers and Hack Clubbers. you can find the staff by our bandanas, but really you all will be the ones who make this event magical. Be kind, be helpful, let's make this the most incredibly weekend that's happened this year.

And with that said, we ran [the prompt segment](prompt.md#selecting-a-prompt)!
