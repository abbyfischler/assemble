## Opening Ceremony Script

_"Hackers, ASSEMBLE!" Video_

Sam: Good evening everyone! And welcome to Assemble, here in San Francisco. We're incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to host you for a special weekend. Many of you have traveled many miles to join us, we're humbled. Wherever you've traveled from, we hope to make this weekend magical for you.

My message to you is simple, use this weekend as an opportunity to adventure, both technically and socially. Build the unexpected project at demos, create new friendships and develop everlasting memories.

We don't want to stop at this weekend, however, we want this weekend to kickstart a renaissance of IRL high school hackathons. 

Zach: Launch Hackathons.

Video: Airplane Safety Video on Logistics

Welcome to the Hack Air. Our first priority on every flight, is the health and safety of our passengers and crew. We appreciate your full attention as we demonstrate the safety requirements and logistical details of this aircraft.

There are two floors open at today's hackathon. You are currently located on the fifth floor of the office in the Courtyard area. The sixth floor is our designated sleeping area. It will open from midnight tonight to 10:00am tomorrow and from 10pm tomorrow night until 7:00am on Sunday. 

To travel between the fifth and sixth floor, you will need to have a crew member to open the door at each floor. Please have your badge and, if applicable, freedom waiver wristband visible at all times. Between the hours of 6AM to 10PM, those with permission as per their waiver, may leave the office.

Throughout our journey, the crew will make announcements about upcoming service. To keep up to date, please watch your phone for SMS messages. Critical communications will also be made in-person and through the microphone.

COVID-19 & Monkeypox are ongoing public health emergencies in San Francisco, we ask that all attendees are mindful of these health emergencies and precautious. N95 masks, hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray are available throughout the venue. As a precaution against Monkeypox, please avoid close contact and wash hands frequently. If at any time you experience symptoms of COVID-19 or Monkeypox, please approach a crew member immediately for support. After the event, a self-report link will be made available to all attendees to provide anonymous contact tracing.

We are here to support you and to make this event safe for you, thank you for your cooperation in making this event amazing. 

Christina: safety, who to contact, being kind etc. Bring everyone on stage and highlight who is staff.

Ishan & Bash: We've got an exciting schedule lined up for this weekend. _run through schedule_

Ian: Throughout this weekend, we'll all be sharing what we get up to on our Scrapbook. You'll be able to find it at `assemble.hackclub.com`. On there, you can explore or post both ships and scraps. A scrap is a moment from the event, it could be the dinner you make, when you fix a bug, add another feature to your project or a curiousity you find on the scavenger hunt tomorrow. On the other hand, a ship is a finished project or as close as you'll get to one this weekend. For every ship you make you'll recieve a card such as this one. When we demo our projects, we'll each be able to scan these cards using NFC or the QR code and then select five emojis to describe the project. The emojis you choose will decide who wins what at the closing ceremony. 

Let's all try it out, get out your devices, head to `assemble.hackclub.com`, log in with your Assemble ID and post a selfie with those around you as a Scrap.

Sam: There's one thing I can imagine is on all of your minds, what should I build? A week ago, we asked you to submit prompt ideas, now, we're going to use those to choose a prompt, together. We hope this prompt will inspire you and set you off in a creative direction, but it's nothing more than a prompt and certainly not a requirement.

Sam: We've got a theme, a scrapbook to post to, we've ran through the schedule and are all set with our theme of [INSERT THEME]. So what are we all waiting for? Get chatting with the folks around you, start brainstorming [INSERT THEME] projects, grab some Vietnamese food for dinner and let the hackathon begin! 

### Notes used for Opening Ceremony V2

- team based event (just u or up to 4 people)

- prompt to guide, i don't even know what it is, in a couple of minutes, real-time, we're going to vote on it

- all night tonight, all day tomorrow you and your team are going to build a project based on the prompt

- as you progress, you'll be updating and shipping on your scrapbook. to do that you'll want to head to scrapbook.assemble.hackclub.com, login with your Assemble ID and upload a photo!  over the course of the evening, our team will be helping you get set up.

- we end at 8am Sunday.

- On sunday, there's twist, no judges, in fact, every single one of you are judges

- Everyone's going to get a booth where you and your team are going to demo your projects for two hours, and everyone will vote on each other's projects with Scrapbook & emoji. demo a project with code that runs, don't make a slideshow.

- the judging criteria is to build a project you're proud of, what ever that means to you. something useful or something useless, it doesn't matter. all we're aiming for is a project that makes you smile with pride. 

- there's over 15 different prizes that range from the funniest hack to the most cursed project, that you all will be . prizes are custom made arcylic plaques that come alongside goodies such as electronics kits and orpheus plushies. 

- over the course of this weekend, we have a ton of fun activities planned that range from catered vietnamese food for dinner tonight to a music show put on by Lux, who built their own synthesiser from scratch. we'll share the full schedule with you over text and at the end of this ceremony. personally, i'm super phsyced for tonight's "untalent show"

and with that I have short safety video from max.

and listen, the last thing i want to say before we start voting on the prompt. we're all here together, you, me, the assemble team we're high schoolers and hack clubbers. you can find the staff by our bandanas, but really you all will be the ones who make this event magical. be kind, be helpful. let's make this the most incredibly weekend that's happened this year
