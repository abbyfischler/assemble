# ðŸ’¤ Sleeping

Sleeping took place in three different areas on Floor 6 (a dedicated floor for sleeping): a male area (30% of the floor space), a female area (40% of the floor space) & a gender neutral area (30% of the floor space). The floor was dimly lit with minimal sound for hackers to rest. We encouraged all Hack Clubbers to bring sleeping bags to the events. Most slept on the floor with a sleeping bag, some used couches & some used chairs. We also had supervisors in the sleeping rooms being supportive who could help Hack Clubbers in the case of an emergency.
