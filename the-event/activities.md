# Activities

A 42-hour hackathon with a 24-hour hackathon worth of time spent coding and the rest of the time spent having fun. That's how @msw described Assemble to me. He's right and that's what I loved about Assemble. So as weird as it sounds, here's how we made "fun" at Assemble.

## DIY Fun

Early in Assemble's planning stages, we had activities scheduled every hour throughout the day & night... but something didn't feel right. It's easy to fall into the trap of too many activities as an organiser. We changed course, however, because some of the most memorable moments are the moments created in the moment by attendees! This meant we stripped back on the activities, choosing to focus on a select few planned activities and focusing on create a great enviroment to have fun in. So, as we setup the venue we created spaces & laid out activities that attendees could use at anytime they wanted. For example, we setup a "Board Games Station" with a bunch of board games that attendees could take and play with friends. 

A couple of other things we did:

- Allowed anyone to use the main projector (for example, to play Jackbox games)
- Opened up Figma's conference rooms for attendees to hang out in and use the big screen (for example, to watch a movie)
- Setup a photo booth with stickers stuck on corkboard
- Setup a moodboad-style corkboard display
- Had a free flowing snacks & drinks bar

In the end it worked really well! Here's an excert from Assembling Assemble in which I talk about how great this felt:

> Another thing that was so wonderful was how Hack Clubbers really made the event their own. Especially on Saturday night where we had people running their own movie nights, Jackbox games and chair races to name a few things. At the opening ceremony I said "really you all will be the ones who make this event magical. be kind, be helpful. let's make this the most incredibly weekend that's happened this year". That vision came to life, thanks to all the Hack Clubbers.

## Freedom Waivers & Exploring SF

More than 50% of our attendees had flown into San Francisco, it'd be mean for us to lock them in an office and not let them see the city! So to allow participants to go explore the city we created the Freedom Waiver system. On our Event Liablity Waiver, parents could choose to let there child leave the venue between 6AM & 10PM unsupervised to explore the city. This created some really special moments for attendees:
