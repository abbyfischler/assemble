# ðŸŒ® Food

Assemble provided five meals to attendees: two dinners, two breakfasts and one lunch. We used a variety of methods to deliver these meals. The dinners were catered by restaurants. The breakfast were assembled from items purchased from supermarkets. For the lunch, we provided attendees money to go buy their own lunch on a scavenger hunt. We also provided snacks & drinks, purchased from supermarkets. Our venue (Figma) also kindly provided us a full pantry of snacks & drinks.

## Dinners

On the first day, we served Vietnamese food from [Perilla Vietnamese Cuisine](https://www.perilla525.com) in San Francisco. We choosed it because it was Pranav's (from the organising team) favourite resturant in the city & it didn't disappoint! Attendees really enjoyed the noodles & rolls. Many of them were expecting pizza so it was a pleasant surprise!

On the second evening, we served up Build-Your-Own Chipotle. It was really nice for attendees to have the ability to build their own meal and get creative with it! Unfortunately, we ran out of food (one downside of BYO food is that portion sizes are variable) at the end so we had to order some extra pizza at around midnight.

## Breakfasts

Each morning, we kept breakfast simple. Around 60% of attendees ate breakfast and at all sorts of times (from 6AM to 1PM...). For breakfast, we served an assortment of muffins, pastries, fruit and cereal (most of which was purchased from Costco). We also served up leftover ice-cream on the second morning & noodles on the first morning. Breakfast was simple but it got the job done. It also gave us some extra snack supply throughout the day.

## Food Scavenger Hunt (Lunch)

We turned lunch into a fun activity, read more on [`/the-event/fun.md#food-scavenger-hunt`](/the-event/fun.md#food-scavenger-hunt)!

## Snacks & Drinks

We had a self-serve snack & drinks bar open to attendees throughout the hackathon. It was stocked to the brim with snacks (such as chips, energy bars & chocolates) and drinks (such as CocaCola, iced tea & Red Bull). We sourced all of our snacks from Costco alongside the snacks gifted to us by Figma. We also had a coffee machine for attendees to make coffee!
