# 🎁 Prizes

At Assemble, we kept prizes small & numerous. We wanted attendees to feel motivated to build an awesome project but for the hackathon to remain friendly & collaborative at the same time.

Here are the prizes we brought to the event to give out:

As you can see, we had a ton of prizes! We ended up giving everyone who attended a prize, with the smaller prizes going to those who didn't win an award at the event (we had to reuse some event supplies such as workshops hardware as prizes to cover every attendee).

In addition to purchased prizes, we also fabricated some of our own. In Vermont, we had access to a laser cutter where we were able to create custom plaques based on Hack Club Slack emojis. Using the laser, we etched designs (designed in Figma) into 1/4" thick acrylic pieces (4" by 6" in size). We've open-sourced all of our designs at [hack.af/assemble-plaques](https://hack.af/assemble-plaques).
