# Prompt

_or, "what do we prompt people to build..."_

## Intent

By default, if we just tell people to show up and hack, we'll probably see similar results as regular hackathons. Eg.

- automated trash can
- gamified todo list / volunteering platform
- social network that solves {racism,global warming,SOCIETAL_ISSUE}

If we have the right prompt, we should see everyone interested in what they're building, no BS projects, and a celebration of the technical work being done over a buisiness plan/powerpoint.

The prompt goes hand-in-hand with [judging](judging.md).

## Proposal

Judging subteam: Ishan, Ian, Max

### Prompt tournament

We'll change wording to 'prompt' instead of 'theme' since we simply want these to inspire ideas.

One week before the hackathon, attendees are sent a simple, one question form for their prompt idea. The final prompt will be chosen from all of the responses using a tournament-like system, where four prompts 'compete' at a time and the winning prompt moves to the next stage.

```
                  |
   |         |         |         |
| | | |   | | | |   | | | |   | | | |
```
_An example scenario with 16 total prompt ideas (the |s represent ideas)_

At the end of the opening ceremony, attendees are directed to take out their phones and go to https://assemble.hackclub.com/prompt (proposal URL, not live). The website is a site with 4 community-contributed prompt choices. Let's pretend we have an example scenario where there are 16 total prompt ideas. Such a scenario would involve two stages of voting, as the poorly-done ASCII 'art' illustrates. For the first round, everyone is put into four groups (one group for each bunch of prompts at the bottom level), with each group voting for the best of their four choices (selected by majority). The next stage has only 4 choices left, so everyone votes on this final stage, and the final prompt is selected by majority. 

If there were 64 choices, there would have been a larger bottom stage with 16 different groups (general rule is n/4). When moving from that stage to the stage with 16 choices, people would be reassigned a group randomly. Non power-of-4 numbers can be handled by just having fewer choices sometimes.

After all of this, the website shows the top prompt. We may also include the 'semifinalists' so people aren't stuck in the unlikely event that the final prompt ends up being super unworkable.

This kind of prompt system would naturally close the opening ceremony, and leave everyone with creative energy and a conversation topic for dinner time: _"Hey, what choices had you gotten?"_

Prompt ideas Ishan and Ian came up with in ~20 minutes : "childish", "your own", "hackerman", "unnecessarily complex", "fake stuff", "fabric & structure", "speed". A good strategy we found for coming up with prompts was to 'reverse-engineer' your (or your friend's) past projects: try to come up with a prompt that would fit that project. 

Sam prompt ideas: "down under", "javascript hell". idea: glasses with arduino so when aussies visit the northern hemisphere everything is the right way up. another one: real life crocodile dundee: zach's whackamole but find a croc. another one: aussie translator - "hello" becomes "GDAY MATE" and is read aloud

"speed" could evoke devtool building or assembly/C programming, I gave Sam "unnecessarily complex": "to-do list app but it's 6 factor authentication, and your list items have to be base64 encoded wait no emoji encoded and then when you want to check something off, you ... machine learning to see that you do 20 push ups and then it needs an email confirmation from your boss that you've done the task and finally you have to say what the task was to make sure you remember what you did. oh and meanwhile it's in the format of an nsa dashboard like you see on hackertyper yeah?" _wow, sam!_
