# üõ†Ô∏è Workshops

At Assemble, attendees hosted their own workshops! Those interested chose a topic they were passionate about / a project they thought would be fun build with others. We then helped them create a plan & structure for their workshop. We made sure that, bar a couple of exceptions, in each workshop attendees would produce a compelling, specific, real project, using real code.

Here are a couple of the workshops Hack Clubbers ran:

- How to Build a Minecraft Farm with Kubernetes
- Shiny Crystals and Electricity: Using Mathematical Programming to Simulate Piezoelectric Devices
- Creating a DIY Yubikey
- Code Music Live!
- Make your own programming language with JavaScript

On the day, we created handouts with all the workshops & gave workshop leaders a conference room for them to run their workshop in. When it was time for workshops, we herded attendees into the rooms and the Hack Clubbers took it from there!

Here's an example of a workshop, Kayley's `Building Social Confidence & Talking to People`:

Here's [the full schedule](https://assemble-schedule.hackclub.dev) for those interested!

Overall, workshops were a massive success for the following reasons:

- The workshops Hack Clubbers ran were incredibly unique & creatively inspiring. We also had a diverse range of topics!
- Hack Clubbers got excited by seeing other Hack Clubbers running workshops! They were also incredibly supportive of their friends running workshops.
- Hack Clubbers got to build real projects and learn real skills, that they could then use in their hackathon projects.

Thank you to every Hack Clubber who made the workshops magical!
