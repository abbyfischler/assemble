One week on and we've made a fair bit of progress. We've got a full time of 9 Hack Clubbers now working on the project. That team has been brainstorming what a magical hackathon looks like. Alongside that, we've also began reaching out to venues. We've reached out to GitHub, OpenAI, Cloudflare & GitHub. So far, GitHub & Figma have came back with positive responses which is a good sign!

This week we're going to start ramping up and hopefully will make good progress on the venue front.
