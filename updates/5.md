# Assembling Assemble #5

> Work-in-progress!

This week I did something a little different! Instead of one lengthy update, I created daily [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com) posts for the week and have collated them here!

**July 30th ~ Assembling Assemble (Scrappy Edition) #1** 

Spent the weekend tying up loose ends on the logistics front, writing more code for Scrapbook @ Assemble (name suggestions, please!) & preparing the ceremonies. Most importantly, however, @Dev, @bash ìÜè & @kunal are in town so we went around exploring Vermont! It was lovely to talk about the hackathon with everyone (alongside other, slighly less stressful topics) and to get geared up for a jam-packed week.

**August 1st ~ Assembling Assemble (Scrappy Edition) #2** 

Wrapping up for the day! Got one day left in VT until Assemble. Spent most of the day fixing up things and making sure everything is set to go. Also a lot of emailing! And @Dev & I shipped this massive box of fun supplies‚Ä¶. around 10 kilos of swag, prizes and sharpies :D
