# Assembling Assemble #2

üëã G‚Äôday friends!

Wow-za! I‚Äôm back here. It‚Äôs been seven more days working full-time on Assemble out here in Vermont. And well since last Friday, everyday has felt like climbing up a mountain. On Saturday, we actually climbed a real mountain: [Camel‚Äôs Hump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_Hump).

_(1,244 meters in the air, looking over Vermont ü§©)_

All the other mountains are figurative, however. Just as challenging though, if not more!

Let‚Äôs start with where we started this week: at the weekly team sync! Here are my notes (try decoding them, I dare you):

![0020220712_120258](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud-j22s0wrle-hack-club-bot.vercel.app%2F0020220712_120258.jpg)

Somehow, my sync update ballooned from one Post-it to three Post-its‚Ä¶. you should have seen me‚Ä¶ I was full on rapping! It was pretty satisfying and motivated to get a big cheer at the end of all that, all it cost was my voice.

## Stunning Views

I started this journal on a bit of a negative note when talking about mountains, but mountains can also be wonderful adventures with stunning views (such as the one above!). Let‚Äôs talk about some of the _(figurative)_ stunning views from this weekend‚Ä¶

-   **The whiteboard from Saturday.** _[retracted, confidential]._ Just kidding‚Ä¶ @ced, @Caleb & I brainstormed a board-full of fun things to make Assemble a magical experience. My brain had been blocked on this for a while and the moment we got talking suddenly the blockade in my head started falling, brick by brick (this imagery is weird, TLDR I got unblocked when we started talking). Moral of the story is that three brains are better than one, ask people for help.

-   **The swag mockups!** Oh my! @Hugo is doing a stunning job with this swag‚Ä¶ especially the lanyards. Once we get the mockups / prototypes @ HQ, I‚Äôll post them in my #scrapbook so keep an eye out for those!

-   **My DMs.** Right now I have 24 unread (it was 0 this morning, I swear). That‚Äôs stunningly horrible, I know, but that‚Äôs not what I mean when I put DMs on this list! It‚Äôs when I click on each them it becomes a stunning view because of all the cool workshops people are planning to run! @Bash & @Ishan sent out a wonderful email to everyone and having doing really well working with everyone to nail down their ideas. I‚Äôm very happy this won‚Äôt be like CodeDay Singapore where it was only boring old me running every workshop. I might even be able to attend a couple of these workshops this time :D _(PS: I will respond to all these DMs tonight, I promise!! pinky promise?)_

_Awesome Hack Clubbers, all with awesome workshop ideas!_

-   **Having a big todo list on my whiteboard.** It‚Äôs not very stunning‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs better than having 500 things running around my head. So relatively stunning? Thank you @kara.

-   It‚Äôs 4:04pm! Previously our **security guards** were no where to be seen, so you could have said they 404-ing. Too much of a stretch? I thought so too. Anyhow, it was amazing to see _$1,890.00_ drained from our Bank account for a security firm‚Ä¶ sighs‚Ä¶ at least it‚Äôs done now. This positive seems to have turned sarcastic. I‚Äôm genuinely so relieved to have done that!

-   I‚Äôm super happy about this graph I made of predicted energy levels at the hackathon. Take a look for yourself, do you think this is how it‚Äôll pan out?

-   Last thing‚Ä¶ **the plan for the renaissance**. Assemble is only the first step, this year we‚Äôd really like to launch a couple of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù or two for hackathon organisers (like we do for club leaders each year!). There are a ton of exciting ideas bouncing around, [it‚Äôd be great to hear yours](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0C78SG9L/p1657989241898719) :D

## The Deep Question

Now there were some stunning views on the hike of this week (yep, I‚Äôm still trying to continue this metaphor), but it was a TOUGH hike with steep hills and long distances‚Ä¶ all of these challenges has raised a deep question.

> English Translation: I‚Äôm going to present the challenges of this week as a series of questions and I should stop trying to be a poet.

**Why are people coming to Assemble?**

I have this awful habit of overthinking everything. And I‚Äôve been doing it a lot this week. We were preparing the hackathon‚Äôs run-of-show and I was going through every 30 minute time block, and there were blank ones! And I was stressing! But then a conversation with @ced & @kara (which brought together other conversations with @msw & @zrl from throughout the week) course corrected for me. People want to meet awesome people from the Slack & build with them. So let them do that! He walked me past hackathon experiences of his and it really helped me pull things back a bit and refocus. Thanks @ced. I was so tired in the moment that I probably looked dead, but I‚Äôm very grateful. It‚Äôs about finding a balance in the level of activities we have and the time we give for natural magical interactions to happen, we‚Äôre not there yet, but we‚Äôre getting closer.

This leads onto 100s more questions: what do people expect from us? What can we do to enhance those natural interactions (do we need to?)? How do we break the ice? All questions to answer next week, but where I‚Äôm going with this is that I needed that reminder to put myself in the attendee‚Äôs show and design the event that way.

## The Boulders Needing Climbing (The Other Challenges)

500 thoughts running around my head has been replaced with 500 challenges this week. I won‚Äôt bore you with them all but here are the major ones:

-   **Motivation.** This is for me and the whole team, we‚Äôre in the weeds right now and it sucks! We‚Äôre working out the nitty gritty stuff and we‚Äôve been doing it for a fair while‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs getting a bit of a drone for myself and I sense that the team is feeling that too. I don‚Äôt have the solution here, it‚Äôs been plaguing me all week. The ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù period is over and I‚Äôve got figure something out to keep us all going!

-   **Sleep.** Or more general tiredness‚Ä¶ I can feel this all around HQ. In my ‚Äúcorner of the office‚Äù, we‚Äôve got three projects in crunch mode (Sprig, Assemble & Sinerider)‚Ä¶. plus a ton of other stuff going on that I barely know anything about across the office! That means stress. That means lots of work. And it‚Äôs tiring. The only solution is sleep, shocking am I right? I recommend asking Ishan about his sleep schedule (or lack thereof) üòâ

-   **Uncertainty.** I would say that the uncertainty for Assemble is ¬±5.10m, what ever that means. (that was meant to be a joke, sorry) What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that there a fair few uncertainties in our plan right now that are causing mental block for me at the time. I‚Äôm going to try and break down those walls next week! But my general advice would be to try to avoid getting yourself in these situations by getting over these hurdles early. A good way to do this is by talking through your event with someone.

-   **Imposter Syndrome.** I‚Äôm trying not to repeat myself from last week and I‚Äôm still not sure if this is the right word for it but this is something that‚Äôs still lingering over my head. @kara talked me through this well today and I‚Äôm going to keep taking a step back and reminding myself where I am and the goals of Assemble.

There‚Äôs more and I could go on, but those are the big ones. I also promised a follow up on some of the challenges from last week, here‚Äôs my best attempt.

-   **Meetings:** use focus time on your calendar and try not to do coding in short sessions but instead dedicate a couple of hours

-   **Being Overwhelmed:** write everything down. (And give yourself the satisfaction of crossing things off!)

-   **Communication & everything else:** still figuring it out :/

## The Summit
  
So we‚Äôve reached the summit, AKA the end of the week. Where are we? Well we‚Äôre in a great place with registrations (I forgot to mention! Our numbers are going through the roof!) and a solid place with the schedule. In all tangible aspects I feel like we‚Äôre doing well, I just am feeling stressed for the weeks ahead. It‚Äôs going to be tough, but just writing this journal has really helped me feel better about things. I want Assemble to be something that I‚Äôm proud of, that the team‚Äôs proud of and that is special for all the attendees. We‚Äôre 80% of the way there, just that 20% real steep!

The summit is a place for reflection, and a lot of reflection leads to gratitude. I‚Äôm still grateful to everyone I mentioned last week! But I want to mention some more specific things. I‚Äôm grateful to everyone who has talked through things with me this week , talking things through has really helped me this week. @Ishan also deserves a special shoutout for being a super kind roommate and making spectacular food, plus helping me destress (I‚Äôm also very grateful to @christina & @zrl for sharing their cooking with me as well this week and in @christina‚Äôs case an entire dungeon to stay in whilst Ishan had COVID)! I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to everyone who‚Äôs given their belief in my this week, it‚Äôs been a rollercoaster of a week and it means a lot.

Thanks for taking the time to read this all, I hope you‚Äôre enjoying them! If you‚Äôve got any feedback or anything you‚Äôd like me to start including in these, let me know!

If it‚Äôs alright and you‚Äôre still around I was wondering if you could help me with these questions:

-   What do you want to get out of Assemble?
-   What is a great hackathon you‚Äôve been to and why was it great?
-   What has made a hackathon bad for you previously?
  
With gratitude,

Sam

Now for some fun things I discovered this week & got up to this week!

Let‚Äôs start with my proudest achievement: hoisting the Australian flag at HQ. You may have seen how American my desk is with those big old stars and stripes! I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve one upped that.

<img src="https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud-9df210gey-hack-club-bot.vercel.app%2F0screenshot_2022-07-15_at_7.57.59_pm.png" width="400px" />

In other news, I finally worked out how to take the bus into work (confession: I got off the wrong stop and had to walk 15min to HQ), look at how cute this little bus is!

<img src="https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gannett-cdn.com%2Fauthoring%2F2019%2F06%2F01%2FNEYE%2Fghows-IA-8a345f73-2b1c-0d95-e053-0100007fe0c9-d1910f9e.jpeg" width="400px" />

At first I thought it was an ambulance! This bus. is nothing like the big bus that goes to my school in Singapore (but I still love it):

As I alluded to earlier, Ishan has been taking us a bit on a bit of a cooking adventure, here‚Äôs some of the things we‚Äôve (well really him, I do the dishes and hold things up) made‚Ä¶

<img src="https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud-7wz9j7bn0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app%2F0img_9523.jpg" width="400px" />

Now it‚Äôs been a lot of Italian this week but that‚Äôs going to change tonight because @kara showed us the wonderful store that sold Asian food (mostly frozen, though):

<img src="https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud-t9qmw673t-hack-club-bot.vercel.app%2F0screenshot_2022-07-15_at_7.51.01_pm.png" width="400px" />

The best find was some Singaporean / Malaysian Milo! [Which is different from Australian Milo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI1YDhAdvgo) (and IMO slightly worse‚Ä¶ but hey? It‚Äôs still Milo!).

That‚Äôs a wrap from me! We‚Äôre heading to Montreal this weekend and I‚Äôm going to try and relax & reset this weekend for a big week of work next week :D
