# 🙏 Thanking Your Venue

After Assemble, we did the following to thank Figma for the kindness:

- Left 🍫 custom chocolates in the office for our direct point of contacts at Figma.
- Placed [custom coasters](/further-reading/coaster.svg) in the office for Figmates to use for their everyday coffee/tea.
- Hosted a retrospective meeting with our point of contacts at Figma to thank them & reflect on the event.

In general, after the event, make sure to show your venue just how much you appreciate them!
