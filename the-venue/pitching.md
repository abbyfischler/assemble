**Subject:** Bringing Together Hack Clubbers @ Figma SF?

Hey Dylan!

Sam & Belle, here, we work with Christina Asquith & Zach Latta at Hack Club. Every summer Hack Club runs something special. In 2020, we ran[ Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/) and in 2021, we traveled across America on[ The Hacker Zephyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BID8_pGuqA). This year we want to combine Summer of Making’s scale / impact and The Hacker Zephyr’s IRL magic at Assemble, Hack Club’s 2022 summer event.

Assemble will bring together 150 high school hackers from around the globe for a three-day magical hackathon in San Francisco this summer. You can expect the traditional Hack Club antics and more. For example, we’re looking at having a life-sized dinosaur robot (that hackers can hack on over the event) rove the event! Not only will Assemble be a magical hackathon, it’ll also set the gold standard for future high-school hackathons. Our goal is to redesign the blueprint for future hackathons: every component of Assemble will be open sourced (similar to[ The Hacker Zephyr repository](https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr)) and carefully documented for future organizers to bring to their own communities.

Assemble needs a home in San Francisco and we were wondering if Figma could host us for a weekend (Friday 6:00pm to 12:30pm on Sunday) in late July / early August at your office in SF?

I remember hearing about your rapping at the Figma Variety Show during the Hack Club AMA, that’s the exact vibe we’re going for at Assemble! Alongside the photos we’ve seen on social media and us all using Figma on the regular, the Figma office is shaping up to be the perfect venue for Assemble.

Thank you for considering our request and we look forward to hearing from you! We would love to jump on a call to answer any questions or iron out details.

Thanks,

Sam & Belle
