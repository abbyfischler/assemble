# Opening Ceremony Script

_"Hackers, ASSEMBLE!" Video_

Sam: Good evening everyone! And welcome to Assemble, here in San Francisco. We're incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to host you for a special weekend. Many of you have traveled many miles to join us, we're humbled. Wherever you've traveled from, we hope to make this weekend magical for you.

My message to you is simple, use this weekend as an opportunity to adventure, both technically and socially. Build the unexpected project at demos, create new friendships and develop everlasting memories.

We don't want to stop at this weekend, however, we want this weekend to kickstart a renaissance of IRL high school hackathons. 

Zach: Launch Hackathons.

Welcome to the Figma HQ. Our first priority at every hackathon, is the health and safety of our attendees and crew. We appreciate your full attention as we demonstrate the safety requirements and logistical details of this office.

There are two floors open at today's hackathon. You are currently located on the fifth floor of the office in the Courtyard area. The Courtyard plays host to all major events of this hackathon. Also on the fifth floor, you will find a vast open space for programming, six conference rooms for workshops and two kitchens for meals. 

The sixth floor is our designated sleeping area. It will open from midnight tonight to 10:00am tomorrow and from 10pm tomorrow night until 7:00am on Sunday. Please use the space respectfully in the evenings to sleep. The space is separated into a gender neutral, a female and a male sleeping room. Please feel free to approach a crew member, as indicated by this red bandana, at anytime.

To travel between the fifth and sixth floor, you will need to have a crew member to open the door at each floor. If a crew member is not present at the door, please ring the doorbell and a member of the crew will open the door for you. Please have your badge visible at all times. Between the hours of 6AM to 10PM, those with permission as per their waiver, may leave the office. To do so, please show your wristband to onsite security on the 5th floor. Please make sure to return by 10PM, thank you. 

At times in our journey, you may want to connect to the wider internet. WiFi is available throughout out this journey and can be accessed at the SSID `Hack Club` and with the password `dinosaurbbq`.

Throughout our journey, the crew will make announcements about upcoming service. To keep up to date, please join the Hack Club Slack & the #assemble channel. Everyone can join at hack.af/assemble-slack. Critical communications will also be made in-person and through the microphone.

COVID-19 & Monkeypox are ongoing public health emergencies in San Francisco, we ask that all attendees are mindful of these health emergencies and precautious. N95 masks are available throughout the venue and are recommended for all participants. All participants and crew tested negative for COVID-19 before attending today, but if at any time you experience symptoms, please approach a crew member immediately for support. Likewise, please be mindful of the spread of Monkeypox within San Francisco. As a precaution, please avoid close contact and wash hands frequently. Hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray is available throughout the venue. If at anytime you develop a rash, please approach a member of the crew immediately. After the event, a self-report link will be made available to all attendees to provide anonymous contact tracing.

We are here to support you and to make this event safe for you, thank you for your cooperation in making this event amazing. 

Christina: safety, who to contact, being kind etc. Bring everyone on stage and highlight who is staff.

Ishan & Bash: We've got an exciting schedule lined up for this weekend. _run through schedule_

Ian: Throughout this weekend, we'll all be sharing what we get up to on our Scrapbook. You'll be able to find it at `assemble.hackclub.com`. On there, you can explore or post both ships and scraps. A scrap is a moment from the event, it could be the dinner you make, when you fix a bug, add another feature to your project or a curiousity you find on the scavenger hunt tomorrow. On the other hand, a ship is a finished project or as close as you'll get to one this weekend. For every ship you make you'll recieve a card such as this one. When we demo our projects, we'll each be able to scan these cards using NFC or the QR code and then select five emojis to describe the project. The emojis you choose will decide who wins what at the closing ceremony. 

Let's all try it out, get out your devices, head to `assemble.hackclub.com`, log in with your Assemble ID and post a selfie with those around you as a Scrap.

Sam: There's one thing I can imagine is on all of your minds, what should I build? A week ago, we asked you to submit prompt ideas, now, we're going to use those to choose a prompt, together. We hope this prompt will inspire you and set you off in a creative direction, but it's nothing more than a prompt and certainly not a requirement.

Sam: We've got a theme, a scrapbook to post to, we've ran through the schedule and are all set with our theme of [INSERT THEME]. So what are we all waiting for? Get chatting with the folks around you, start brainstorming [INSERT THEME] projects, grab some Vietnamese food for dinner and let the hackathon begin!
