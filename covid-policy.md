## Before the Hackathon

### Vaccination Requirements

All attendees will be required to submit proof of full vaccination including additional boosters that may become available and recommended before August. Attendees may be asked to show proof at a pre-event check-in and at the entrance of the venue, so **attendees should bring their proof of vaccination**.

### Covid Test Documentation

We require all attendees & organizers produce the results of a negative antigen test within 24 hours of the event. For convenience, tests will be provided at the venue before the event so attendees who don't have their own tests can take one before checking in. Everyone testing at check-in will slow down the event though, so we encourage attendees to test on their own before checking in.

<!-- @msw: Ah, hello there! you're reading the raw markdown, aren't you? I'm commenting this out because we don't have any applicants at the time of writing with a medical excemption & I'd like to keep the wording concise (why cover an edgecase we don't have). If it comes up we can uncomment the following line: -->
<!-- If an attendee is not vaccinated (in the case of a medical excemption), they must produce the results of a **negative PCR test** within 24 hours of the event. -->

### Travel Stipends

Recipients of travel stipends flying in to attend will need to take their tests before boarding their plane.

## At the Hackathon

### Resources

Rapid tests will be provided in the open for anyone to use and hand sanitizer will be located throughout the venue.

Masks are not required at the venue, but will be available for anyone who wishes to wear one.

The venue will have signs posted with directions to testing and steps on how to self-report a positive test using the [self-report link].

### Self-report Response

If an attendee or organizer begins to show symptoms and/or has a positive test, they must isolate and leave the event. They are responsible for coordinating housing.

We will send a notification email to attendees with exposure details if there is a positive test.

## After the Hackathon

### Reporting post-event positive-tests

If an attendee or organizer has a positive test within 10 days of the event, they should report the possible exposure to [self-report link].

To ensure attendees and organizers remember to self-report after the event, a scheduled email will be sent with the [self-report link].
