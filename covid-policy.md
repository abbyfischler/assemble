## Before the Hackathon

### Vaccination Requirements

All attendees will be required to submit proof of full vaccination including additional boosters that may become available and recommended before August. Attendees may be asked to show proof at a pre-event check-in and at the entrance of the venue, so **attendees should bring their proof of vaccination**.

### Covid Test Documentation

We require attendees produce the results of a negative antigen test within 24 hours of the event.

If an attendee is not vaccinated (in the case of a medical excemption), they must produce the results of a **negative PCR test** within 24 hours of the event.

## At the Hackathon

### Resources

Rapid tests will be provided in the open for anyone to use and hand sanitizer will be located throughout the venue.

Masks are not required at the venue, but will be available for anyone who wishes to wear one.

The venue will have signs posted with directions to testing and steps on how to self-report a positive test using the [self-report link].

### Response

If an attendee begins to show symptoms and/or has a positive test, Assemble organizers will provide a space to isolate and rest.

If an attendee has to isolate, we will send a notification email to attendees with exposure details.

## After the Hackathon

### Reporting post-event positive-tests

If an attendee or organizer has a positive test within 10 days of the event, they should report the possible exposure to [self-report link].

To ensure attendees and organizers remember to self-report after the event, a scheduled email will be sent with the [self-report link].
