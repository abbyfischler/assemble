## At the Hackathon

Rapid tests will be provided in the open for anyone to use. Masks will be available for anyone who wishes to wear one and hand sanitizer will be located throughout the venue.

If an attendee begins to show symptoms and/or has a positive test, Assemble organizers will provide a space to isolate and rest.
