# ðŸ’³ Budgeting

Every hackathon needs a budget. Quite simply, a budget will make sure you don't run out of money!

To create one, start a spreadsheet and list out your costs. For costs that change depending on the amount of attendees (for example, t-shirts), list a per-person cost & then a total cost (which is the per-person cost multiplied by your expected attendee count). 

The three most important categories to budget for are: [food](/the-event/food.md), [swag](/the-event/swag.md) & [prizes](/the-event/prizes.md). For food, explore the catering menus of restaurants & fast-food outlets for prices (for breakfasts, take a look at Costco or your local equivalent's pricing). For swag, take a look at the prices on [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com) & of any local print shop (sidenote: Sticker Mule often [sponsors hackathons](https://www.stickermule.com/support/will-you-sponsor-my-organization) with swag). And for prizes, select the items you'd like to give out and then look at their prices on their respective retailers.
