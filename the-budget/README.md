# ðŸ’¸ The Budget

> Placeholder description!

Assemble had a budget of \$75,000, that's a large budget for a high school hackathon. HS hackathon budgets can range anywhere from \$500 to \$75,000. Whatever your budget is, you'll find a similar set of expenses will arise between all hackathons. Every expense made for Assemble has been open sourced [here](https://bank.hackclub.com/assemble) through Hack Club Bank's [transparency mode](https://headwayapp.co/bank-changelog/transparent-finances-(optional-feature)-151427). As an organiser, you'll need to raise money, create an itemized budget (which accounts for the unexpected) and then spend the money raised as planned.
