# üõÇ Visas

Assemble was an international hackathon and we drew attendees from around the world (like India, Nigeria, Singapore, and more). To bring these hackers to San Francisco, we had to gain a deeper understanding of the US immigration system, eventually landing on a B1 Business Visa for conference purposes with an expedited interview request (further details can be found here:[ https://hack.af/assemble-int](https://hack.af/assemble-int)). Since a hackathon is a conference or convention of sorts, that‚Äôs the broad category that we placed Assemble under. To support our attendees‚Äô applications, we also wrote a visa letter covering:

* Details of the conference
    * Name, date, and location of the conference
* Who Hack Club (the organizer) is
    * Our mission/vision
    * Past events and supporters (to increase credibility)
* The importance that the named attendee (within the letter referred to as delegate) attends this hackathon
    * We invited them to as a speaker
* Other logistical details
    * Personal details of the attendee (eg. Name, Passport Number, Date of Birth, etc.) to show that this letter was explicitly for the named attendee
    * Details on cost splitting (for Assemble, it was shared between the organizer and the individuals)
* Final plea and invitation to reach out for more information
    * Eg. On behalf of The Hack Foundation, we would be extremely grateful if you could grant {{name}} a visa as we look forward to their contributions in San Francisco. In the case of any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us via +1 (973-437-6822) or[ team@hackclub.com](mailto:team@hackclub.com).

(Note: the letter also included our letterhead and address and came from the ‚ÄúExecutive Director of Assemble‚Äù)

Assemble also helped some of our international attendees prepare for their interview with the key takeaways: be prepared, be polite, don‚Äôt share more information than asked, and convey that you‚Äôre going to the United States SOLELY for the purpose of this conference. Some questions asked to our attendees:

* Where are you studying and when do you graduate?
* What do your parents do?
* Why are you going to the US?
* Do you have any friends or family in the US?
* Who is sponsoring your trip?
* How do you know your sponsor
* Can I see a letter from them inviting you (the visa letter we wrote was shared)?
* How long will you stay there?
* Where in the US are you going?
* Which hotel will you stay in?
* Why were you selected to speak at this conference?

Most information compiled in this preparation process came from days of research and talking to people that have been granted visa interviews. Assemble had an approximately 50% success rate for Visa applications (all rejections due to an inability to procure an expedited interview, something that can be improved with a longer application window). Organizing an international event brings a new level of financial and logistical challenge but the ability to connect hackers with a shared love for making from around the world is unparalleled.
