A unique part of Assemble, being a Hack Club event, was that we wanted to have a global audience. To achieve this, we offered travel stipends to attendees to help them make it to San Francisco.  These were given in the form of a reimbursement after attendees booked their flights. We had a cap of $500 for domestic attendees & $750 for international attendees. You can view the breakdown in our budget!

We distributed the money using Expensify, offered through Hack Club Bank. We transfered the money the moment flights had been booked & we'd recieved the reciepts, this was slightly risky because we couldn't be certain that they'd turn up. Fear not, 100% of travel stipend reciepients showed up! We only funded transportation & direct costs associated with making it to San Francisco. This felt like the right balance.
