# ðŸ˜Ž Guests

We kept guests at Assemble super simple. Zero keynote speeches. Zero panels. Zero marketing pitches. Our only ask was that folks come along and hang out with Hack Clubbers, ask about their projects and be friendly! This made sure that the event felt hacker-focused and not like a corporate event. 

Here's an example of an email to a potential guest:

```
Hey John, 

Hope you're great. Any chance you and Jane are around SF Aug 5-7? 

Zach and I would love for you to come by Hack Club's summer hackathon in SF, kicking off Friday, Aug 5. 

There will be 150 Hack Clubbers coding for 42 hours, at Figma HQ. Dylan will be coming by and a few other tech leaders. 

Would be insane if you dropped by and coded for a bit/ chatted with the Hack Clubbers.....  I think they'd be pretty excited about that!  Anytime works! 

Hackathon details [here](https://assemble.hackclub.com/).

Below is a invitation for our supporters.

We didn't push guests super hard, so, only a couple came but for those who did it felt super natural & friendly.
