## Intent

By default, if we just tell people to show up and hack, we'll probably see similar results as regular hackathons. Eg.

- automated trash can
- gamified todo list / volunteering platform
- social network that solves {racism,global warming,SOCIETAL_ISSUE}

If we have the right theme, we should see everyone interested in what they're building, no BS projects, and a celebration of the technical work being done over a buisiness plan/powerpoint.

The theme goes hand-in-hand with [judging](judging.md).

## Proposals

### No theme

This is the base case. The default. Expect more experienced hackers to get working on their own projects. Team formation is probably based on how well people pitch their idea.

Entry-level coders end up not having a direction & will probably attend a workshop or two to while trying to find a direction, so we should make sure the workshops the first night are heavily focused on actionable outcomes ("concepts of html" -> "build and host your first website in an hour").

We'll probably encounter similar pitfalls of regular hackathons, 

### Build for yourself

This theme would be a classic prompt-style theme for the event.

The intent is to guide entry-level to beginners who aren't sure where to start, while still being interesting for the most technical people.

The most technical attendees are already building things for themselves (tools, websites, homelabs, etc.), and the beginners won't get distracted by the business-plan side of things.

The intent is to address some of the issues that many hackathons run intoâ€“ projects that promise too much. You [can't solve societal problems in 24 hours](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hackathons/#prize-incentives), so this theme has built-in scope.

### Wheel of fortune (Random prompt)

Attendees are assigned random themes. Methods of distributing the theme include...

- Drawing cards from a hat
- [Wheel of fortune](https://www.amazon.com/Spinning-Wheel-Markers-Eraser-Prizes/dp/B07ZQ387P3/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=wheel+of+fortune+wheel+spinner&qid=1657994445&sprefix=wheel+of+fortune%2Caps%2C77&sr=8-17)
- [A theme generator website](http://summer.hackclub.com/ideas)

### Kahoot

At the end of the opening ceremony, attendees are directed to take out their phones and go to https://assemble.hackclub.com/theme (proposal URL, not live). The website is a site with 4 questions, which attendees can vote on to select a theme (like Kahoot). Each question has 3 words or fragments, and the whole event comes up with a theme together, possibly with options such that they always form a sentence. (we could also 4 choices per question, but Ishan worries that could be too many options for someone to be sure of their choice). 

Like in Kahoot, voters immediately find out which option was picked the most. Unlike in Kahoot, voters will be able to decide what options are presented. Since this question will then have a lot of choices, a live-updating list sorted by votes should be implemented.

After they've made the choices, the website shows the top theme made of the words most picked. We can also include the 2nd and 3rd best choices so people aren't stuck if the top choice ends up being super unworkable. (we can go through all 81/256 possible themes to see if there are any like this)

This kind of theme system would naturally close the opening ceremony, and leave everyone with creative energy and a conversation topic for dinner time: _"Hey, what'd you pick for the adverb?"_

Example choices:

Adverbs:

- dangerously
- unequally
- woozyily
- biblically accurately

Verbs:

- betting
- merging
- hunting
- weakening

Adjectives:

- illegal
- raspy
- fluffy
- nutritious

Nouns: (These are to be chosen by the attendees)

- department
- prophet / profit
- potato
- zero

_who doesn't want a theme like **"woozily hunting raspy prophet"**?_
