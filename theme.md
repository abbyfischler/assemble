## Intent

By default, if we just tell people to show up and hack, we'll probably see similar results as regular hackathons. Eg.

- automated trash can
- gamified todo list / volunteering platform
- social network that solves {racism,global warming,SOCIETAL_ISSUE}

If we have the right theme, we should see everyone interested in what they're building, no BS projects, and a celebration of the technical work being done over a buisiness plan/powerpoint.

The theme goes hand-in-hand with [judging](judging.md).

## Proposals

### No theme

This is the base case. The default. Expect more experienced hackers to get working on their own projects. Team formation is probably based on how well people pitch their idea.

Entry-level coders end up not having a direction & will probably attend a workshop or two to while trying to find a direction, so we should make sure the workshops the first night are heavily focused on actionable outcomes ("concepts of html" -> "build and host your first website in an hour").

We'll probably encounter similar pitfalls of regular hackathons, 

### Build for yourself

This theme would be a classic prompt-style theme for the event.

The intent is to guide entry-level to beginners who aren't sure where to start, while still being interesting for the most technical people.

The most technical attendees are already building things for themselves (tools, websites, homelabs, etc.), and the beginners won't get distracted by the business-plan side of things.

The intent is to address some of the issues that many hackathons run into– projects that promise too much. You [can't solve societal problems in 24 hours](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hackathons/#prize-incentives), so this theme has built-in scope.

### Wheel of fortune (Random prompt)

Attendees are assigned random themes. Methods of distributing the theme include...

- Drawing cards from a hat
- [Wheel of fortune](https://www.amazon.com/Spinning-Wheel-Markers-Eraser-Prizes/dp/B07ZQ387P3/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=wheel+of+fortune+wheel+spinner&qid=1657994445&sprefix=wheel+of+fortune%2Caps%2C77&sr=8-17)
- [A theme generator website](http://summer.hackclub.com/ideas)

### Kahoot

During the opening ceremonies, attendees are directed to take out their phones & go to https://assemble.hackclub.com/theme (proposal URL, not live). The link redirects them to a pre-populated kahoot with 4 questions. Each question has 4 words, and the whole event comes up with a theme together. The words wouldn't form a whole sentence– they'd more be fragments of a theme that need to be worked into a project. Example fragments:

- games
- built for yourself
- prophet / profit
- potato
- zero
- [you only have one](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/)
- biblically accurate
- [that's a stupid idea](https://stupidhackathon.com/)
