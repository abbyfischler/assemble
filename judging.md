Judging subteam: Ishan, Ian, Max

## Intent

Ask any hackathon attendee about judging & they can bring up a negative experience they've had or heard about. That said, judging provides important things to the event such as...

- a goal to work towards
- a place to ship/demo & "strut your stuff"
- closure to a long, hard sprint
- a structure for first-time hackathon goers

## Proposal

We’ll have a science fair “demo period” at the end of the event for 2 hours.
Before this period, hackers will have posted their projects on scrapbook & picked up their “demo cards” for their shipped projects.

Hackers will go around and see other projects & when they want to vote they’ll scan the demo card for that project.

Starting a little before the 2 hour period ends (~15 min), judges will convene to discuss which prizes to give out.

Some will be pre-defined:
- Most upvoted (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Best game
- Best beginner
Some will be judge’s choice:
- Most hacky/janky/wack
- Most cursed

Categories that are chosen by judges should mostly follow the emojis. Judges can choose from a set of plaques we create before the event. Some plaques will have random symbols/logos to give judges flexibility to come up with their own projects. We’ll throw away the unused plaques.

### Demo cards

_Working title_
Has a QR code to a specific scrapbook post. Attendees can pick them up throughout the event after posting a scrap. Should be customized (include scrapbook image + description ideally) so attendees want to take them home. If we have the time we can get nice laser cut plaques that the printed cards go onto.

### Voting

Attendees vote for each other’s projects by scanning their demo cards & being taken to a page on scrapbook for voting. Voting is not started on scrapbook (like scrolling through an index of projects). My votes are anonymous (like the website for scrapbook), but scraps show the total counts for each. The project index lets me sort by reactions, but not see reaction count.

### Scrapbook

We’ll need to add individual pages for each scrap, and make a new type of scrap- the “ship”. Ships will need to have co-authors & a “project name” field.

Other nice-to-haves for admins:
- A way to see an index of projects sorted by reaction counts

### After judging / after event

A couple things need to change/happen on scrapbook after judging goes out:
- Emoji counts on index pages show up
- Move from scrapbook.local to scrapbook.assemble.hackclub.com (both example URLs)
- Migrate posts from assemble scrapbook to main scrapbook.hackclub.com.
