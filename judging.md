## Intent

Ask any hackathon attendee about judging & they can bring up a negative experience they've had or heard about. That said, judging provides important things to the event such as...

- a goal to work towards
- a place to ship/demo & "strut your stuff"
- closure to a long, hard sprint
- a structure for first-time hackathon goers

## Proposals

### Hackathon judges

This is a base case. Normal hackathon-style judging with science fair desks & project numbers. During a judging period, judges go out to each table and review a demo. Each judge should be a field expert (technical, design, etc.) so they can understand what they're reviewing.

At the end of the demo time, judges get back together and compare rubrics.

Winners are announced at closing ceremonies. There is no 1st, 2nd, 3rd. We'd laser-cut a couple trophy/plaques in advance with categories like...

- outstandingly polished
- most technically advanced
- outstandingly hacky
- the biggest fish (random one open to interpretation)

Judges also have discression to create a category on the fly & we'd have someone standing-by at a local makerspace ready to laser cut the name for a new trophy.

### Scrapbook presentation with Reddit-style voting

The event's network hosts hackbook.local (proposal URL, not live), a locally hosted fork of [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com). Hackers can sign in and post their projects. Scraps ("posts" on Scrapbook) can have multiple co-signers (ie. "Posted by Alice & Bob"), and flagged as "shipped".

During the hackathon, posting a "shipped" scrap will print a physical copy of the ship on a laser-cutter.

At the end, we'll announce a "demo period" where hackers can go around and see each other's projects. After going to a project table and hearing a demo, attendees can scan the physical scrapbook card for that ship (nfc, qr, etc.) and vote by reacting to the "shipped" scrap.

There is no 1st, 2nd, 3rd. Categories are based on reactions:

- Most upvotes
- Best design (most :art: emojis)
- Mixtape award (most :fire: emojis)
- Most banana emojis (random categories created at organizer discression)

Some prizes can be related to categories. Most cumulative hand emojis (:clap: :raised_hands: :+1: :ok:) gets a bag of [tiny plastic hands](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=100+tiny+plastic+hands&crid=3HKG2H61AN8TP&sprefix=100+tiny+plastic+hands%2Caps%2C130&ref=nb_sb_noss) for each member of the winning team.

Depending on the [theme](theme.md), some emojis can correspond to specific parts of the theme.

### Speed dating presentation with tier-list voting

Teams face each other in two rows (randomly assigned), and one side demos their projects. Each demo takes a set number of minutes (two, perhaps), after which the other team places them on a 7-tier-list, and then the demo-ing row rotates so they can face the next team. Once a full rotation is complete, the other side is shuffled (so people don't demo to the same team they got a demo from) and then demos their projects the same way.

There can be categorized tier lists: a "Creativity" list, a "Sillyness / Hackiness" list, etc.

At the end, a website shows the top performers in each category and also overall.
